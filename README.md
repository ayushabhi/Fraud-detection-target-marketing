# Fraud-detection-target-marketing
Two distinct projects unified by a shared approach to problem-solving. Dive into the Fraud Detection and Target Marketing projects, each addressing unique challenges in data analytics, yet connected by a cohesive strategy for insightful solutions.

# Introduction
Immerse yourself in the evolving landscape of machine learning through our recent projects on Fraud Detection and Target Marketing. This repository showcases the implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, utilizing hyperparameter tuning techniques to enhance model precision and effectiveness.

# Objective
This project aims to achieve the following objectives:
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers by adjusting at least three hyperparameters for each model.
